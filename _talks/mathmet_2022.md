Oral presentation at MATHMET 2022 on Visualsing uncertainty in 3D scan compleition and data distiliation using Kmeans clustering. [Slides here](https://mattmdjaga.github.io/files/MATHMET_2022.pdf). Selected as
highly ranked abstract by the Executive Committee. 

Work consited of using ensemble methods to find the mean and variance of 3D scan to generate point clouds labelled with uncertainty. We also found the using Kmeans to bin embedded data and sampling uniformly from each bin we could distil the data to a smaller set of points that still captured the underlying structure of the data, beating random sampling.
