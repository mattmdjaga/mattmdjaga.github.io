I'm an incoming PhD student at Queen Mary Univserity of London in the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. I'm supervised by [Dr. Julia Ive](https://julia-ive.github.io/) and [Prof. Maria Liakata](https://maria-liakata-nlp-group.github.io/team/pi.html). My PhD will revolve around anonymisation of and using foundation models, which will consist of topics such as alignment, mechanistic interpretability, red teaming and other similar topics.

Pre-PhD
======
I hold a BEng in Electronic & Electrical Engineering from University College London (UCL), where I wrote a dissertation on "Spatio-Temporal models for fall detection". After University I worked as a Research Engineer at Visio Impulse for a bit over a year, where I worked on applied ML across vision and NLP. Then I joined [PONS.ai](https://www.pons.ai) as an AI Engineer where I worked in generative vision and I still work there. I also had 2 internship stints at [R42 Group](https://www.r42group.com)

Outside of work I train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in which I hold a purple belt from 10th planet London. I also like contributing to open source projects, which you can find on my [Hugging face profile](https://huggingface.co/mattmdjaga) and hopefully soon on a computer vision course on Hugging Face which I helped out with.
